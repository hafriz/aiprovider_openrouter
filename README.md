# OpenRouter AI Provider for Moodle

This plugin integrates the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API with Moodle's Core AI framework, enabling text generation, text summarisation, and image generation actions from Moodle placements.

> **Note**: According to [Moodle plugin naming conventions](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/checklist#code-repository-name), this repository should ideally be named `moodle-aiprovider_openrouter` to follow the pattern `moodle-{plugintype}_{pluginname}`. While not a strict requirement, this helps provide a consistent experience for Moodle developers.

## Copyright Notice

This plugin (aiprovider_openrouter) is based on the original aiprovider_openai plugin by Matt Porritt. Portions of the code and design are derived from Matt Porritt's work. All rights reserved to the respective authors.

## Features
- Supports the core AI actions `generate_text`, `summarise_text`, and `generate_image`.
- Configurable per-action model selection and endpoint URLs.
- Adds the required OpenRouter headers (`Authorization`, `HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`) automatically.
- Optional global and per-user rate limiting using Moodle's built-in rate limiter.
- Unit tests covering provider authentication, request construction, rate-limiting, and response handling pathways.

## Requirements
- Moodle 4.5 (build 2024100100) or later.
- An active OpenRouter account with a valid API key.

## Installation
1. Copy the `openrouter` directory into `moodle/ai/provider/`.
2. Visit `Site administration → Notifications` to trigger the plugin installation and database upgrade.

## Configuration
Navigate to `Site administration → Plugins → AI → OpenRouter API provider` and configure:

- **OpenRouter API key** – create a key in your OpenRouter account and paste it here.
- **HTTP-Referer header** – required by OpenRouter; set this to the public URL of your Moodle site (for example `https://example.edu`).
- **X-Title header** – optional friendly name displayed in your OpenRouter dashboard (defaults to the Moodle site name).
- **Per-action settings** – for each supported action you can define the default model (e.g. `openrouter/auto` or `openai/dall-e-3`), endpoint URL, and system instructions.
- **Rate limits** – optionally enable and configure global or per-user hourly request caps.

After saving the settings, ensure that each AI placement selects OpenRouter as its provider and chooses the appropriate action.

## Testing
Automated tests live under the `tests/` directory and exercise the provider, processors, and rate-limiter behaviour. From the Moodle root you can run:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit ai/provider/openrouter/tests
```

*(Depending on your environment you may need to install PHPUnit via Composer first.)*
