# OpenRouter AI Provider for Moodle

This plugin integrates the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API with Moodle's Core AI framework, enabling text generation, text summarisation, and image generation actions from Moodle placements.

## Features
- Supports the core AI actions `generate_text`, `summarise_text`, and `generate_image`.
- Configurable per-action model selection and endpoint URLs.
- Adds the required OpenRouter headers (`Authorization`, `HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`) automatically.
- Optional global and per-user rate limiting using Moodle's built-in rate limiter.
- Unit tests covering provider authentication, request construction, rate-limiting, and response handling pathways.

## Requirements
- Moodle 4.5 (build 2024100100) or later.
- An active OpenRouter account with a valid API key.

## Installation
1. Copy the `openrouter` directory into `moodle/ai/provider/`.
2. Visit `Site administration → Notifications` to trigger the plugin installation and database upgrade.

## Configuration
Navigate to `Site administration → Plugins → AI → OpenRouter API provider` and configure:

- **OpenRouter API key** – create a key in your OpenRouter account and paste it here.
- **HTTP-Referer header** – required by OpenRouter; set this to the public URL of your Moodle site (for example `https://example.edu`).
- **X-Title header** – optional friendly name displayed in your OpenRouter dashboard (defaults to the Moodle site name).
- **Per-action settings** – for each supported action you can define the default model (e.g. `openrouter/auto` or `openai/dall-e-3`), endpoint URL, and system instructions.
- **Rate limits** – optionally enable and configure global or per-user hourly request caps.

After saving the settings, ensure that each AI placement selects OpenRouter as its provider and chooses the appropriate action.

## Testing
Automated tests live under the `tests/` directory and exercise the provider, processors, and rate-limiter behaviour. From the Moodle root you can run:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit ai/provider/openrouter/tests
```

*(Depending on your environment you may need to install PHPUnit via Composer first.)*

### Continuous Integration
This plugin uses GitHub Actions to automatically run Moodle Plugin CI tests on every commit. The CI workflow tests the plugin against multiple PHP versions (8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3) and database engines (PostgreSQL and MariaDB) to ensure compatibility and code quality.
